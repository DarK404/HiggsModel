# HiggsModel
A multiperspective model of the Higgs robot.

Model-driven Engineering is an engineering method that uses models as central assets for system development. System models have always been a central resource for engineers (e.g. to do simulations) but the scope and applications of models are continuously increasing.

The purpose of this project is to 1) identify model needs, 2) define model structure and 3) populate the system model for a mobile robot: Higgs. The model shall include a **SysML general model**, a **DAE model** of robot dynamics, a **3D model** and a **simulation model** in a robotics simulation environment.
